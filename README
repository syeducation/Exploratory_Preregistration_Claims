Preregistration and Registered Reports restrict exploratory research, right? 
So some people say, but we have limited data related to this claim, and the available 
data suggest the opposite is true.


The purpose of this project is to evaluate this claim. 
This project is currently a proposal to be submitted to COS’s Lifecycle Journal. 
Following a positive evaluation we will carry out the study and report the results 
here. Stay tuned!
